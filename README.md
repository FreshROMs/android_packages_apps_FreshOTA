# FreshOTA - Over-the-Air Update App for FreshROMs

A useful tool to help FreshROM maintainers provide OTA updates to users. With this new version, it now requests proper runtime permissions, and if denied, it will close the app.

The application is forked from TeamBliss' OTA Updater app. **The application, notably its UX, is currently a work-in-progress.**
